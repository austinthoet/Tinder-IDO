# Tinder-IDO
Automates the messaging process with a message of your choice including a provided dictionary of COVID related pickup lines.

Steps to messaging your matches:
1) Open Google Chrome and go to Tinder
2) Go full screen mode because why not
3) Swipe on some pics
4) Now right click and select "inspect"
5) Click 'Console' which will be with developer tools
6) Scroll through all unmessaged matches, so that they are loaded
7) Paste the contents of ignite2022.js
8) Hit enter and let it rip
9) Wait for replies and carry on


This is intended to cut down the time it takes to message all your matches. Additionally, statistics can be taken based on the number of matches that actually message back.
